<a href="http://www.blender3d.org/">Blender</a> is a great 3D modeling and animation tool. It even has a game mode, a video sequencer, and is programmable using good ol' <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Best of all, it's both gratis and libre. That's free as in doesn't cost anything, and free as in you can do anything you like with, <em>and</em> source code is available (I like to use the spanish words instead of "free as in beer" [gratis] and "free as in speech" [libre] like some others).

<p>To show my support, I'm going to try and add a small feature to it over this winter break. A kind of animation preview. I'll add an option to step through the frames by steps larger than one. It can already be done manual by tweaking the animation curves, but I'd like to see it automatic for doing animation preview and such. I'll post again when I start doing work, and I'll also post Windows (and maybe FreeBSD) builds as work progresses, if anyone wants to test it. Meanwhile, back to creating stuff!
