title: Walk softly and carry a joystick

<p>
Wired has a decent <a href="http://wired.com/news/games/0,2101,66225,00.html">article</a> about getting too immersed in video games. While I've never tried to cause a huge crash with my car after playing Burnout (where one of the subgoals is to cause the biggest and most expensive crashes and pile-ups you can), I have <em>thought</em> about how I could manipulate a traffic situation to cause maximum carnage. However, back in high school, when I played Descent a lot, I would get deep enough into the game to slightly effect my perceptions of the real world. When the microwave at work beeped, I would abruptly turn to look for homing missiles heading towards my ship. The microwave beep and the homing missile lock-on signal had very similar pitches. Wired's article actually scared me a bit, though. If there are people who attempt to steer their car into things, I think they may want to lay off the games a bit, for a while at least.
