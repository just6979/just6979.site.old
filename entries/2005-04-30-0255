<p>Just got back from seeing <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, a movie version of Douglas Adams' wonderful novel, with my buddy Sam. I, as a connoisseur of the Guide, found it to be all around great stuff and fitting in snug like a bug in a rug with my expectations and the rest of the versions of itself. I will see it again on the big screen, with a pass I have. it's that good to me, as I expected. Sam, as a newcomer, also liked it, enough to see it again, even, and wants to read the books now, as I also expected.</p><p>I was going to write more, also some about the <a href="/pictures.py/">pictures script</a> I've half completed. It just has my random collection of pictures and the ones Timmy took at Tuckerman's. It doesn't look super yet, but it's only halfway done. More later. Sooner than the last "more later", though.</p>
