title: Fixed Pictures, SuperWiki idea
author: Justin

<p>I fixed the pictures page. It's still not as integrated as the journal, but at least it actually works now. GIFs and some [broken] PNGs don't thumbnail, but that's the Python Image Library, not my code. maybe I should let FreeBSD update it sometime soon. Anyways, I'm motivated about coding again, so perhaps I'll put in some work on the entry markup language for the journal.</p><p>I also had this thought of a wiki-like structure for absolutely everything in a filesystem. A set of scripts to both display, edit and create everything and anything in a given directory, including editing the implementing script itself (of course with revision control to easily revert to a working simple edit script). I need to research more file creation and file permision controls in Python, though.</p>
