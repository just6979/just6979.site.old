title: Back from the cruise

<p>
My family got back from a cruise of the western Caribbean late on Saturday night (It's late Tuesday night now). If you have never been on a cruise before, GO! It's awesome. If you have been before, you know what I'm talking about. So fun! I'm a bit tired now, and Family Guy then Futurama are about to come on (Cartoon Network is so great), so perhaps tomorrow I'll post some details.
