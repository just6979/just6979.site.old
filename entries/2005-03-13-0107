<p>This is the first entry I'm attempting to add through the browser, instead of from the machine itself. Let's see how it goes.</p><p>Wow, only one big snag, and it was another part of the server, not even my script. Of course, it took a while to even get the form displayed. But after that, the progress was quick and easy. I also cleaned up the display of the entry options. Now they (only 'Edit' really) only are shown when viewing an entry directly, not in any listings nor in and editing modes. I also fixed the bug that showed the date where the time should be. And the passwords are no longer being written out to entry files, which could be read through the server, if you know how.</p><p>Maybe now I'll update more often...</p>
