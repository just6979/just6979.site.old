title: Space, says the Guide...

Space, says the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is really, really big. It's so mind boggling big, the chances of being rescued after being thrown out of an airlock are 2 to the power of more than 2 billion.

For some great examples of how hugely vast and hugely amazing space is, check out the <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">Astronomy Picture Of the Day</a>. The APOD almost always has something interesting up there, such as the <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap051022.html">ring galaxy</a> currently adorning my desktop. And the links in the descriptions can provide almost as much clickable craziness as <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> can.
