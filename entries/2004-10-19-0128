title: 'The economic value of lost lives'
author: Justin

<p>Do you have a hand-free set for using your mobile phone in the car? Some <a href="http://www.detnews.com/2004/autosinsider/0410/18/a01-307032.htm">research</a> has concluded that it's the talking, not the holding of the phone in your hand being the problem. But if hands-free isn't the solution, is it banning mobile phone use while driving altogether? Or should we disallow talking while driving, whether on the phone or not? Here's something that caught my mind:</p><blockquote><p>But the Harvard researchers wanted to quantify the potential cost, measured in lost productivity, of banning cell phone use in cars. They concluded that taking cell phones away from drivers would cost $43 billion a year in lost economic activity - about the same economic value of the lost lives and injuries.</p></blockquote><p>Thank you, Harvard researchers, for putting such a nice round number on <em>lost lives</em>. How much am I worth? I didn't realize that keeping Verizon's profits up is better than keeping people alive. (Nothing against Verizon, I'm probably switching to them soon, I just needed a big mobile carrier for an example.)</p>
