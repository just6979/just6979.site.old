<p>So we can watch <a href="http://gprime.net/video.php/nintendothemesacappella">wacky vids</a> (via Eric C) of groups singing the theme songs to some classic games, a capella. Also available, <a href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/mariopiano.html">a blindfolded guy</a> who can play the Super Mario Bros. theme insanely fast on piano. That's all the funny links for now.</p>
