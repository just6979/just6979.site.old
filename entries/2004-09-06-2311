<p>
I just completed the third campaign, the Orcs. It doesn't have as many chapters as the previous, perhaps  because the prelude campaign consists of a few Orc missions. I liked that a few missions in this third campaign are non-town mission, meaning you only get the units you start with, plus a few you pick up on the way. What I disliked a bit is that a couple of the missions take around an hour and a half to complete. Later I'll start the last campaign, Night Elves! This is what I've been waiting for since I first heard of the game.

Next up, about the cruise.
