title: Metroid Prime thoughts

<p>
So I finally started playing Metroid Prime, which I bought about two months ago and then just played (and got killed during) the intro level. What was I waiting for?!!? Did not beating the timed explosion scare me off? I don't think so, because the same thing happened the first few times I played Descent. Anyway, now I'm about halfway through the game as far as powerups are concerned, but I only have 2 of the 12 artifacts I'm searching for. The enemies are tough but not annoyingly difficult. Except for Thardus, who I hate now. My hands are cramped from 3 failed attempts in a row to beat him. Any hints? Even with Thardus causing me trouble, Metroid Prime is still an awesome game. Modernized, going 3D, but keeping the spooky Metroid theme. The controls aren't what I'd call perfect, but they do work. I'd recommend Metroid Prime to anyone who enjoyed any of the previous games in the series.
