I won $20 when the Eagles beat the Falcons to win the NFC. Pennsylvania sending two teams to the Superbowl would be weird, and with the Patriots smashing the Steelers, it'll be New England and Philadelphia trying for the trophy and glory down in Jacksonville. And though the Eagles did get me some cash, I know the Pats are going to whip 'em in two weeks.
