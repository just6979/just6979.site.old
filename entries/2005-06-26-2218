title: So much for karma...

Well, not really. Maybe the title should be "Would you like a grain of salt with your karma, sir?". Golf is still fun, and the other little things are good, but unfortunately, the girl didn't work out.

Fine, that happens. It just would've been nice if she couldn't returned a phone call to tell me I'm not her type. We saw the movie on Wednesday night, she said "Call me tomorrow". I did. Kinda late, but she knew I was working late. I tried again on Friday night, and once more on Saturday morning. Nothing. Not even a text back. So I just left one more voicemail tonight, "Hey, just let me know what's up so I'm not wondering if you're in the hostipal or just don't think it's gonna work out". Thirty seconds later, I got a text, "Sorry, you're not my type". I replied, "Ok, thanks for telling me". Delete messages, delete contact. Done and over. I'm not upset she doesn't think it'll work, that happens. I <em>am</em> kinda ticked she didn't have the decency to just tell me that back on Thursday.

But, whatever, I don't think I want someone who can't do that simple thing. Plus, whenever I meet a girl, I seem to meet at least another, usually two, about the same time, which can be a pain, seeing how much I dislike making decisions. This time it was two, but with one we've decided to just be friends. The other, we'll see, soon ;).
