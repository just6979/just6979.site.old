title: Moved the new site to the old hardware

So I had to take some RAM out of my desktop. I think it was failing and causing hard freezes. It takes the total down  from 640MB to 512MB even, but no more freezes. But, with Firefox open with lots of tabs, Firebug running, and Kate open with a half dozen files, Postgres was getting swapped out and making Apache timeout on XHR requests. It got swapped out sometimes before, but not as often. And it's so not worth buying new PC133 SDRAM at like quadruple the cost of new DDR2 RAM, so I'm not putting any more in. And if you don't know what any of that means, well too bad because I do!).

So I spent an evening and reinstalled Apache, Subversion, Postgres (client), Python, pyPgSQL, and Genshi on this old FreeBSD machine, the one that ran the old website (without any SQL or XML). Copied over ~www and the svn repositories, tweaked the configs and pointed the router (ssh &amp; http ports only) at the new/old machine, and presto-facto, up and running, live and direct. This machine was just sitting around anyway. I think the CD-ROM drive is actually toasted from not being used in literally 5 years. But that's OK because FreeBSD is so easy (but time-consuming) to upgrade on the fly.

Next steps are to get the Postgres server installed and the databases copied, and then get Samba up and sharing to make editing the site easier. Oh, and I also directed the router to point a couple additional ports (for ssh &amp; http only) to my desktop, for easy access for myself. Yay for good tools and knowing how to use them.
