This game was <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> The brothers, Mario and Luigi, more so the former, are the core of Nintendo's best known franchise. The Mario Brothers have been seen on every system Nintendo created since the NES, with multiple games, numerous cameos, and arguably the most successful spin-off franchise ever, <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p><h4>Mario's Friends and Enemies</h4><p>Mario and Luigi are <em>the</em> Mario Brothers. They're originally plumbers of Italian descent, but have gone on quite a few adventures in the Mushroom Kingdom, an odd place ruled by King Toadstool and his daughter, Princess Peach. The kingdom is inhabited by sentient mushrooms, warrior turtles, flying fish, evil lizards, and many other strange creaures. The Princess has been kidnapped a few times by Bowser Koopa, the lizard-like King of the Koopa clan. Mr. Toad Stool, one of the King's mushroom helpers, often assists the brothers on their quest to rescue the Princess from Bowser. Bowser recruits many Mushroom Kingdom natives, and is sometimes assisted by some or all of his seven children. Although Bowser is huge, armored, and breathes fireballs, Mario and his friends invariably find some way to dispatch the tyrant and return Peach to safety. However, sometimes Bowser isn't the one causing trouble, and in one adventure, Mario and friends had to team up with Bowser to save the kingdom.</p><h4>The Early Games</h4><h5>Super Mario Bros.</h5><p>The NES launched with Super Mario Bros. SMB is a simple platform game. You can play as Mario or Luigi, but the only difference is the coloring of their clothing: Mario is dressed in red and blue, Luigi in green and white. Your goal was to infiltrate Bowser's castles and rescue the Princess.</p><h5>Super Mario Bros. 2</h5><h5>Super Mario Bros. 3</h5><h4>Bros. on the Go</h4><p>GameBoy saw the introduction of Mario's arch enemy, Wario, with The Six Golden Coins adventure and a sequel. Mario got intellectual with the Dr. Mario puzzle game, and he stayed fit with the usual sports cameos.</p><h4>The Second Generation</h4><h5>Super Mario World</h5><p>SNES another nomination for best game, Super Mario World, and it's not quite so awesome sequel, Yoshi's Island. However, mario Kart sprang to life on the advanced-for-its-time Super Nintendo. The cartoony racing game themed with Mario's friends and enemies, and their environments was nicely balanced and fun to play against friends. Again Mario cameos in sports titles, often as a judge or referee.</p><h5>Mario Kart</h5><h4>Third Generations, Third Dimensions</h4><h5>Super Mario 64</h5><h5>Mario Kart 64</h5><p>The great Nintendo 64 carried in a breakthrough with Super Mario 64. The whole of the Mushroom Kingdom got a whole lot deeper when they went 3-dimensional. With easy to pick-up, but tricky to master controls, Mario64 changed the platforming game as we know it. Yet the N64 powers on and we get the great looking and way better playing Mario Kart 64. Four player mayhem in crisp 3D, one of the best party games created, period. Donkey Kong, Mario's oldest nemesis, makes a comeback on the N64, even with his own kart game, and a good run of platformers.</p><h4>Cleaning the Cube, Luigi in the Spotlight</h4><h5>Luigi's Mansion</h5><p>Nintendo's latest, the Gamecube, invited Luigi along for the launch, sort of. While no game was included in the Gamecube packaging, <em>Luigi's Mansion</em> was one of the first games available. Next, <em>Super Mario Kart: Double Dash</em> took the fun of karting and added the unique element of two players to a kart. Even if you don't fancy that aspect, it's still good ol' Kart racing. Later, Mario makes a full return in Super Mario Sunshine. Sunshine's water-gun tool was a blast to play with, and create a friendly interaction with the game, instead of the blood-and-guts realism splattered everywhere lately. The super fun physical environment is fun to fool with and a great advantage when you learn it's ups and downs, and get the backflips, triple jumps, and walljumps down pat.</p><h4>Cameos</h4><p>Mario has appeared as a player or referee in many sports games, from Golf to Tennis, on all 5 systems.</p><h4>Super Mario Sunshine</h4><p>The latest (and greatest?).</p><div class="footnotes"><p class="footnotes">Footnotes: this is never going to be done!</p></div>
