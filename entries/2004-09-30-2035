title: Subversion nails compatibility guidelines

<p>
I happened across a news blurb mentioning a new release of the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> version control system. In the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/svn_1.1_releasenotes.html">release notes</a> for version 1.1, they mention come compatibility concerns:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subversion's compatibility and version-numbering policy is documented in the project's <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/HACKING">HACKING</a> file.  Here's a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Database schema</em>: if upgrading to Subversion 1.1, there is <strong>no need</strong> to dump and load your repository. There will be no changes requiring dump/load before Subversion 2.0.
</li>
<li>
<em>Client/server compatibility</em>: a 1.X client and 1.Y server are always interoperable.  However, the latest features or bugfixes may not be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
</li>
<li>
<em>API/ABI compatibility</em>: the 1.1 release only adds new functions; thus a 1.0 program can both compile against and use 1.1 libraries at run-time, but a 1.1 program cannot use 1.0 libraries.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is just perfect! All minor releases on a major branch are binary and network compatible. The rest of the software world, both open and proprietary, needs to wake up to this. I shouldn't need three or four copies of a single major branch of a particular library to make my system work. This is the root of "DLL Hell" in Windows, and if they're not careful, it'll be the source of "Shared Library Hell" in Linux and BSD.
</p>
<p>
This also reminds me of something I noticed in FreeBSD a while back. Many ports specify a certain minor version (the first .#), or even patch version (the second .#) of a required library. I know that Perl 5.8.0 can be substituted for 5.8.2, but many ports want to upgrade for me. Often times I just want to install a new application and not worry about upgrading half the libraries on my system just to use it. Someday I'll take a look and see if this can be easily changed. For now, I'll get back my writing homework.
