title: Authors you should check out

<p>
I just finished Robert Heinlein's <em>Stranger In A Strange Land</em> about two minutes ago. Awesome story. It'll be in the sci-fi section of any bookstore, but it's very soft on the science, almost anyone will enjoy it. I bought Heinlein's <em>I Will Fear No Evil</em> about a year ago, but never finished it. I grok I will start it again and finish it as quickly, yet unhurriedly, as I finished <em>Stranger</em>. My list of "authors you must read at least one thing by" now consists of:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Douglas Adams</dt>
	<dd>So long, and thanks for all the fish. Don't forget your towel.</dd>
<dt>Isaac Asimov</dt>
	<dd>The Robot and Foundation series are wonderful. He will always be one of the best.</dd>
<dt>Ray Bradbury</dt>
	<dd>If only for <em>Farenheit 451</em>, for the same reasons as <em>1984</em>, but he's got lots of goodies.</dd>
<dt>Orson Scott Card</dt>
	<dd>Ender and Bean are what every kid wants to be, yet their stories capture all ages.</dd>
<dt>Arthur C. Clarke</dt>
	<dd>The 2001 and Rama series are undeniable classics.</dd>
<dt>Michael Crichton</dt>
	<dd>From <em>Jurrasic Park</em> to <em>Prey</em>, he rarely disappoints.</dd>
<dt>William Gibson</dt>
	<dd>A cyberpunk evolutionary behind his mirrorshades.</dd>
<dt>Robert A. Heinlein</dt>
	<dd>Simply one of the best.</dd>
<dt>Larry Niven</dt>
	<dd><em>Ringworld</em> stretches the most pliable imaginations out there.</dd>
<dt>George Orwell</dt>
	<dd>Can we consider him a psychic for <em>1984</em>? I first read it just before <em>Stranger</em> and it gave me a good bit of deja vu in light of the goings on of the world today.</dd>
<dt>Neal Stephenson</dt>
	<dd><em>Cryptonomicon</em> is 1100+ pages of imagination food.</dd>
<dt>J. R. R. Tolkien</dt>
	<dd>One story to rule them all.</dd>
<dt>Kurt Vonnegut</dt>
	<dd>Between slaughterhouses and timequakes, he bends minds.</dd>

If you only read one more book in your life, read something by one of these gents.
