title: Descent - Now there is a great video game
author: Justin

<h4>The Game</h4>

<p>
For unknown reasons I thought of a video game I used to play, called <em>Descent</em>. Descent was the first game with truly three dimensional worlds. Along with 3D worlds, Descent has 6 degrees of freedom of movement (up/down, left/right, forward/backward, pitch, roll, yaw). In 1994, already ahead of it's time in graphics and control, also had support for local network games! Not a first, but not yet commonplace.

The mission is to pilot your ship through a mine, on an asteroid where gravity is neglible, hence the 6 degrees of freedom. In your way are robots that work in the mine, but of course they've all gone crazy and are now the enemy. Your goal is to find some keys and make your way to the reactor, and blow it up real good, and the best part, still make it out the exit alive. The enemy robots had decent AI, dodging and hiding. moreso in Descent II. Their variety is the best part, however. Seeing the cannon swing around towards you, or hearing the green crusher coming up behind you meant you were in for a tough battle, with different tactics for each. The mines are mostly squarish tubes connecting bigger rooms in various criss-crossing paths, easy to get lost in.

I've gotten about halfway to three quarters through both Descent and it's sequel, <em>Descent II</em>. I may have finished Descent once, but I'm not positive. I <em>have</em> finished, the second sequal, <em>Descent 3</em>, with it's all-new, next-generation graphics engine. Descent II was just a slightly enhanced and tweaked version with new levels and missions. It also featured pre-rendered cut-scenes and some multiplayer enhancements, but not yet Internet play, which was getting important by mid 1996. The expansion pack, "Vertigo" was simply more new missions. I have yet to play the Vertigo missions, as I haven't yet finished Descent II, thought they came together with the original as a set when I got it in 1997. In addition, to the expansion pack, new missions and levels could be downloaded for both versions.

In the middle of 1999, the big evolution that is Descent 3 came along, with a brand new graphics engine, and full support for Internet play, including a built-in game finder, and website of statistics hosted by the developers. The new graphics engine is most importantly hardware accelerated, so it uses the power of the graphics card to do things faster. This enabled lots of good looking stuff, such as some outdoor levels in addition to mines filled with fog, reflections, smoke-trails and detailed textures. All these pretty looking things needed a powerful machine by 1999 standards. Any machine bought since 2000 will probably run it, and anything 2002 and up will run it well. Descent 3 also had good support for player-created add-ons, mods, with all the tools being posted on the Web.

The source code to both Descent (1998) and Descent 2 (1999) was released open-source under the GPL. The D1X project fixed up the code and created a version of Descent with better networking and tons of other smart stuff. Later the D2X project worked on a better Descent 2, which can now play levels from both the first two games, with better on-line play and even some hardware acceleration. Descent being libre software is great because there will always be a way to play the game, and it'll keep getting better.

<h4>The robot model</h4>

<p>
Thinking about Descent, I decided to model a robot in the theme of Descent using Blender. It took about an hour or so, including a few scrapped gun pod ideas. Perhaps I'll write some Python to export it to something the game can understand and put it in a level to fight it. I've decided that the Blender source code is too complex to deal with at the level I want to be involved, so I'll try some BlenderPython stuff instead.
