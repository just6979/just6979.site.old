<p>
I like to play golf. I'm not that good yet, but I like to practice, it relaxes me, and I'm seeing improvement all the time. Most people at the practice ranges are very nice and give some good tips.
</p>
<p>I'm a born tinkerer, so I have lots of clubs, and know what's supposed to be good about most of them. I also have a bit of an obsession with wedges. I don't have a ton of distance, so anything short game interests me.
</p>

<h3>Clubs</h3>
<p class="note">
Note: The "Tinman" clubs are clubs hand assembled myself. The letters in [brackets] explain the build of the club: head material (Titanium, Stainless steel, Maraging steel, Wood), shaft material (Steel, Graphite, Bi-matrix), and shaft flex (Regular, Stiff/Firm, Wedge). Unfortunately, manufacturers have different ratings for shaft flex, so ratings must be taken with a grain of salt. One's Regular may be another's Stiff, or vice-versa, or they may be very similar. Loft measurements are given where they're known. {Curly brackets} denote a major name clubhead clone.
</p>

<h4>Main Set</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tinman Mad President 9&deg; driver (1&deg; closed) [TGR] {Callaway ERC II}</li>
<li>Tinman Rocket Sonic A2 #3 metalwood (15&deg;) [SSR] {TaylorMade R7 Neutral}</li>
<li>Tinman Rocket President #5 metalwood (18&deg;) [SSR] {Callaway Steelhead III}</li>
<li>Tinman Rocket Sonic 200 #7 metalwood (21&deg;) [SSR] {TaylorMade 200 Steel}</li>
<li>Wilson Golf Advantage X3 #3 - 9 irons (24&deg; - 44&deg;) [SSR]</li>
<li>Titleist DCI 981 Pitching wedge (47&deg;) [SSS]</li>
<li>Titleist DCI Black 52&deg; Wedge [SSS]</li>
<li>Titleist Vokey Raw 256.14 wedge [SSW]</li>
<li>Pixl Golf 1.8 L blade putter [SS]</li>
<li>Titleist DT SoLo</li>
<li>Orbit Golf stand bag with Izzo dual strap</li>
</ul>
<h5>Driver</h5>
<p>
The driver I assembled by hand with heads and shafts I bought on eBay and grips from Golfsmith. The driver is a large-volume (340cc), deep face (57mm), beta-titanium Callaway ERC II clone. It has a Titleist The Fuse graphite shaft. The face is one degree closed, which helps reduce slicing. This club is pretty forgiving, very lightweight, and I can really rip it.
</p>

<h5>Woods</h5>
<p>
The fairway woods I also built myself, shafts from eBay, more Golfsmith grips. The #3, #5, and #7 Tinman Rockets all have True Temper Rocket SensiCore steel shafts, with a TaylorMade r7 fairway (neutral weighting) clone on the #3, a Callaway Steelhead III clone on the #5, and a TaylorMade 200 Steel clone on the #7. I've been thinking about putting a graphite shaft on the #3, but I kind of like the balance of having identical shafts on all the fairway metals
</p>
<h5>Irons</h5>
<p>
The irons I got on eBay. They have simple cavity back heads on True Temper steel shafts and Wilson velvet grips. Their lofts, from #3 to Pitching Wedge, are as follows: 21&deg;, 24&deg;, 27&deg;, 31&deg;, 35&deg;, 39&deg;, 44&deg;, 48&deg;. I measured these myself, since these are an older model iron set and the statistics aren't on Wilson's website any longer. I also have a matching Sand Wedge, but I don't carry it or the #3 iron. The #3 is usually replaced by a #7 wood, since I'm not a great long-iron player. The SW is replaced by an absolutely sweet Titleist Vokey wedge, which has such a wonderful feel.
</p>
<h5>Wedges</h5>
<p>
The Titleist Wedge is the second club I bought after the yardsale purchase. "Black" refers to the DCI model, not the color. The DCI Blacks don't have offsets, while the DCI Golds have progressive offsets (the offset increases as club length increases). It also came from eBay, and I put a new velvet grip on it, because the Titleist textured wrap grip was very slippery when even slightly wet. It's the only club I've ever "thrown" unintentionally. Even so, it's always been one of my favorite clubs, along with my driver and the next wedge. The Vokey wedge I won on eBay. There were some delays in shipping, but it was worth the wait. The Lamkin Crossline Cord grip was virtually brand new, but crooked! Can't anyone outside a pro-shop install a grip correctly? [Besides myself, of course.] The raw finish head had already rusted out, yet the grooves were still perfect, when I received it. Sweet feel, and the finish looks cool. Another favorite club.
</p>
<h5>Putter</h5>
<p>
The putter is a cavity backed blade with an offset shaft and a funky insert similar to a Ping IsoForce putter. The insert is made of small, round, metal pins arranged in the center of the blade. The grip is a Winn Excel style wrap. It came with a headcover that actually stays on, but isn't obtrusive, in the bag. One pin in the insert is a brass colored hexagon. The original must've fallen out, but whoever replaced it did a good job making sure the new pin was installed flush with the rest. Offset shaft, cavity balance, and the insert all combine for a great feeling putter. Another great eBay find.
</p>
<h5>Ball</h5>
<p>
Titleist DT SoLo is my usual ball. It is a low compression 2 piece ball good that is for slower swing speeds. As I my swing progresses I'll probably move to Titleist NXT for extra feel and spin around the greens. I also have some miscellaneous second hand orange and yellow balls I use for short game practice. Orange is much easier to find in the grass than white.
</p>
<h5>Bag</h5>
<p>
The bag I purchased on eBay. The seller didn't mention the single strap is a broken double strap, but I'll forgive that because he shipped it insanely fast and left some balls (some of the orange ones) in the pockets. Plus, I've already found a replacement strap from Izzo that fits great.

<h4>Mini Set</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dunlop Vengeance #3 metalwood (15&deg;) [SGR]</li>
<li>Titleist #5 wood [WSR]</li>
<li>Sounder Pat Simmons #7 wood (21&deg;) [WGR]</li>
<li>Callaway X-12 Big Bertha #6 iron (&deg;) [SSS]</li>
<li>MaxFli Red Dot #8 iron [SSS]</li>
<li>Wilson Golf Advantage X3 Pitching Wedge (48&deg;) [SSR]</li>
<li>Titleist Vokey 200 Series Chrome 256.14 wedge [SSW]</li>
<li>Northwestern Model 600 blade putter [SS]</li>
<li>Back Bay Golf Sunday bag</li>
</ul>
<p>
With some of the extras, I put together a mini set that I keep in a Sunday bag to toss in the trunk on vacations or whenever the main set isn't there, in case I find a range or course nearby.
</p>

<h4>Old Set</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pinnacle Stainless Steel #1, #3, &amp; #5 metalwoods [SSR]</li>
<li>MaxFli Red Dot #2 - PW irons [SSS]</li>
<li>Longridge insert blade putter [SS]</li>
<li>Knight carry bag</li>
</ul>
<p>
Living in my old bag (the one Matt gave me) in the basement. They may be sold someday, but probably not because I'm a packrat. The driver, metalwoods and irons came from the initial yardsale purchase, and I figure this was what the guy selling them had last used.
</p>

<h4>Even Older Set</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wilson Staff II Tour Block #1, #3, &amp; #5 woods [WSR]</li>
<li>Stan Thompson #2 - #9 irons [SSS]</li>
<li>PowerBilt Grand Slam Pitching Wedge [SSS]</li>
<li>Leather cart bag with aluminum hand cart</li>
</ul>
<p>
From the yardsale. The Wilson Staff woods were left in someone's basement and spent some time dampened. They're probably not really safe to use as there's no way to tell how strong they remain. The Thompson irons are old blades, used quite a bit by the previous owner.</p>

<h3>The Backstory (ongoing...)</h3>
<p>
In early June, 2005, I got a bunch of golf clubs at a yard sale for ten dollars. A set in a bag on a cart for $5, and the seller said to come back in an hour, he'd go get more. I went back, and he gave me a big double handful of clubs for another $5. After sorting them out, I had two sets of irons, two sets of woods, two decent drivers (AKA #1 woods), a few assorted irons, and a bag and matching cart. After getting one driver (the best one) regripped for seven dollars, and getting a used bag and putter from a friend for ten more dollars, I had two sets of clubs with bags (one with a cart), and a handful of random irons, all for less than $30. Since the yard sale bag weighs about 20 pounds, and one set of irons is quite old and quite used, they're both going to just sit on the cart in the garage for a while. One set of woods is actually wood (modern ones are made of metal, usually steel or titanium), and a bit beat up from being in someone's damp basement for a while. I damaged most of them the first time hitting with them (minor damage, but it made them dangerous), so they're just leaning in a corner of my room, with some of the random irons.
</p>
<p>
Using the better bag, I put together one full set of clubs: TaylorMade Firesole driver (new grip); Pinnacle #3 &amp; #5 wood; MaxFli #2 - PW irons; Northwestern putter. A couple weeks later, I swapped in a new Dunlop #3 wood ($15) and added very very slightly used 56&deg; Mizuno sand wedge ($10). The wedge I found in the used section at a local shop called Joe &amp; Leigh's, a great place to get new and used golf gear at a decent price. I put more wear on it the first time I used it than the previous owner ever did. I also got some generic headcovers for the woods, and a decent pair of Adidas golf shoes for only $45 from Dick's Sporting Goods. With some of the remaining clubs I put together a smaller set, consisting of: Pinnacle #1 &amp; #3 woods, and Northwestern #5 and #9 irons. Those I'll just toss in my car whenever I take the big bag out, in case I get a chance to hit some balls. As I get new clubs and rotate some out of the main set, I'll add or replace clubs in the second set, probably keeping it six or less clubs. The rest will go with the old woods against the wall, as a little decoration, or on eBay to turn some profit. I also found some right handed clubs in someone's junk on the curb. I grabbed them in case somebody right-handed I know might want to try some golf.
</p>
<p>
I'm a technical person, and I like to know how things work. So I did some research on the Web, and gained a ton of knowledge on golf club construction and technology. I also like to do what maintenance I can, so I regripped the MaxFli irons, because they really needed it and I wanted to try it. The #2 and #3 irons had very old grips that were falling apart. The #4 through PW irons had ugly brown grips that were very fat and had almost no taper. They looked to me like the previous owner was trying "Natural Golf". I've now realized they may also be special grips for someone with arthritis. They funky texture and jumboness makes it easier to hold if your joints bother you. I screwed up only twice in the gripping process. In one early attempt, I lost grip of the grip and it stuck with only about a fifth of it on the shaft. Combined with my stingy use of grip solvent (gasoline) in the beginning, that slip meant I had to cut the grip off. One down. The other mistake was not completely cleaning the (very) old grip tape off a shaft. The two tapes, made soft by solvent, bunched up under the grip and made it very bumpy. A couple others were slightly bumpy, but not worth cutting the grip off. Not too bad for my first time. Next up is removing and attaching shafts and club heads, using a heatgun and heat sensitive epoxy (like putting a new blade into an aluminum hockey stick, which I've done). After $40 for grips, tape and solvent, the total spent on equipment thus far is $140.
</p>
<p>
In August 2005, I rediscovered eBay, and its golf section. My first purchase was a Titleist DCI Black 52&deg; Wedge for $20, including shipping. This club is sweet! Then I discovered that Joe &amp; Leigh's uses eBay to get rid of slow sellers from the shop floor. Most of these items have starting prices of one dollar, no reserve, and since it's only about 20 minutes away from me so I don't have to worry about shipping costs. From them I got an Adams Golf SC Ti818 FC 9&deg; driver and an Adams Golf Tight Lies 13&deg; Strong #3 wood. The driver is a Fade Control model, with a slightly closed face and toe-biased weighting to help prevent slices. From another big golf seller, I picked up a pair of Tommy Armour 845 I-Woods (18 &amp; 21 degrees) for $35, and a couple of Mitsushiba and Wilson iron sets, using combined shipping to keep the cost down.
</p>
<p>
I'll compare the new irons with my MaxFlis and resell the unchosen sets. Another option is to use all those iron sets as trade-ins towards some nice used Titleist or Callaway irons (wishful thinking, I know). I'll have to see what the local shops have in the used and discount sections, and what they'll give me for the stuff I have. I also bought a few club heads on eBay. I'll either get some shafts too, or maybe just pull shafts from some old woods (the old Pinnacles maybe). I don't have a real shaft puller, but I can rig something. I always like doing anything I can do myself, such wrenching on my bike and changing my own oil. Depending on how that works out, I'll either auction the resulting clubs or put them in the backup set.
</p>
<p>
I ended up choosing the Wilson Golf Advantage X3 irons I bought on eBay. Through eBay I sold the other irons I had purchased on eBay, and the profit just about equalled the shipping I paid to get them. However, I think I'll hold onto the MaxFli irons. Someone mentioned they're really quite old, maybe collector's items since MaxFli doesn't make clubs anymore. Plus they have a weird construction and look nice, especially with my good gripping job.
</p>
<p>
In early September, 2005, I bought a sand wedge that matches the Wilson irons for $10 on eBay. From the same seller, I got a brand new insert putter for $1 (not counting shipping, which was decent because they combined it with the other club). Since I accidently very slightly bent the shaft near the head of the Mizuno wedge, I decided to just use that for hacking around the beach (my friend Sam lives very near some sand flats on Cape Cod), and bought a Ben Hogan (whose book on golf fundamentals helped me <em>a lot</em>) sand wedge real cheap ($7) from Joe &amp; Leigh's eBay store to go in the mini set. I really don't need three sand wedges, but I really like Ben Hogan and it was super cheap. However, I'm disappointed that whoever installed the quality Lamkin Crossline grip installed it crooked. Doesn't affect play, but looks poor. Meanwhile, the TaylorMade Firesole driver I had regripped sold on eBay, for twenty dollars. Since it came with a two dozen other clubs for ten dollars, plus seven for a grip, that's an OK profit.
</p>
<p>
Mid Sept, 2005. Shafts, grips, and shafting epoxy arrived, so I should have some nice custom built metalwoods soon. But first, I'm going to check the library for some clubmaking books. I don't want to hack up those shafts and end up doing it wrong and building crappy clubs. If they come out well, I'll probably sell some of the metalwoods I currently have. Then I can say I play with clubs I built myself, which is cool.
</p>
<p>
Late Sept, 2005. I've assembled some of the shafts, heads and grips. The club built using the 9&deg; driver head on the Titleist shaft by Aldila with the sweet (especially for only seventy cents each) GolfSmith grips is a great driver. Very light, decently forgiving, and a killer off the sweet spot, especially for less than $20. The other graphite shaft I got matches nicely with the Adams Tight Lies clone head I picked up. However, I'll practice my reshafting skills completely because I want to try the TaylorMade fairway wood clone head that's in the mail on that shaft as well. The new driver is definitely taking over in the main set, and the other fairway woods will come together as I play with different shaft lengths and flexes.
</p>
<p>
Any new clubs came from eBay. The Vokey's are super sweet. But anyways, I've gotten some new stuff for my bike that is taking up my time. Plus, winter is approaching, and with it comes snowboarding, so I probably won't add much to the golf backstory anytime soon. More will come next year when I start playing more.
</p>
