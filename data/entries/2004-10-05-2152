title: Programming 3D is tough on the brain.

<p>
I'm a bit ahead of the class in Computer Graphics, so I've been working on a game-like program. I'm trying to get a viewpoint flying around a room, but getting it to pitch, roll and yaw like an airplane is tough. With the normal rotation commands, only the first is absolute, subsequent ones are relative to all that came before. Which means, for example, when the view is yawed (left/right rotation) 180 degress, pitching (up/down) becomes inverted, which is not what I want. I know it's possible, because flight simulators and lots of games do it correctly. It just takes a fair amount of math, and my head hasn't been into math lately. Hopefully that'll change before the couple of math tests coming up.

Also, I changed the style sheets to display the main content of each page in a serif font (with the little curlies at the ends of the letters), while keeping headings and other small snippets of text in a sans-serif font. I read that serif fonts are easier to read in long chunks, while sans-serif fonts make it easier to identify individual letters and words.

(A bit later, but not worth a new entry) I updated the journal script to fix a mistake in counting how many entries to display, and made it a bit more efficient as a side-effect.
