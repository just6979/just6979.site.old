title: Caribbean Cruise!

<p>
So my parents took my sister, my brother, and I on a 7 day cruise of the western Caribbean. Here's how it went.
</p>
<h4>Thursday, August 12</h4>
<div class="sub-entry">
<p>
We had a flight out of T. F. Green Airport in Warwick (but it's always referred to as Providence). No delays or anything happened. We got to Fort Lauderdale Airport at about midnight.

My mom had booked the flight early so we would have a day in Florida to hit the beach, shop, and just relax. However, hurricane Charlie had just passed by, and there was still a good amount of wind. Throught the morning and most of the afternoon, there was a constant sandstorm six inches to a foot above the beach, and the currents on the water were very strong. That all calmed down around 4 or 5, so we went back to the beach after a late lunch, then ordered some pizza.
</p>

<h4>Saturday, August 14</h4>

<p>
We got a hotel shuttle to the pier at noon. Going through customs and ship check-in took about an hour. There was a lifeboat drill at 4:00 PM, and the ship departed at 4:30. I spent the rest of the afternoon in the pool, and got a bit sunburned on my shoulders. Dinner, as everyday on the cruise, was at 8:30, and was a casual night tonight. Our tablemates were Ira, Lynn, and Andrea, a family from New Jersey. Ira and Lynn had been on dozens of cruises, and Andrea, their daughter had been on at least 14, so they had all kinds of interesting stories.
</p>

<h4>Sunday, August 15</h4>

<p>
Today was an at sea day. We just cruised all day, heading towards Jamaica. The ship passed about 30 miles off the northeast coast of Cuba. The island was visible for most of the afternoon. I finished a book, listened to some music, and played some volleyball with my dad. Our team lost, it's hard playing in almost 5 feet of water, and the net was quite high, but it was fun anyway. Tonight's dinner was formal, which was nice.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Monday, August 16</h4>
<div class="sub-entry">
<p>
We docked at Ochos Rios (Eight Rivers), Jamaica at 7:00 AM, and the passengers headed for their tours at 9:00. My parents and sister booked a private tour that took them around a bit of the island, snorkeling, and up Dunn's River Falls, a very popular set of waterfalls that you can climb up. My brother took a party boat tour, which ended at a beach, where he spent the afternoon talking with Jamaicans and drinking rum.
</p><p>
I took a bike tour of a bit of the island. We took a shuttle to an old plantation 2,000 feet above sea level, then took moutain bikes 8 miles back down to the coast. Along the way, we stopped and our guides gave us some history of the island. For example, I learned the Jamaican flag, a black X with yellow on top and bottom and green on the sides, stands for the struggles of the people, the bright sun, the lush green plants of the island. At the bottom we spent a bit snorkelling in a little cove, and of course they offered us some great Jamaican rum, although only 100 proof, not the 151 proof they promised.
</p><p>
On the shuttle back, I met Matt Diego, from Miami, who did the jungle canopy tour instead of the biking because he screwed up his knee in a motorcycle accident. We talked about bikes for a bit, then the guides put in some Bob Marley, and we all started singing along. I went back on board ship for some lunch, read a bit, and then headed back ashore to just wander around. I forgot that my parents were at Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville, or I would have headed there.
</p><p>
As we left port, a gentleman from Newton, MA, noticed my Red Sox visor introduced himself and his sister-in-law, Todd and Aliza. Aliza happened to be a girl that I had noticed earlier and couldn't keep my eyes off. Later in the afternoon, I met the rest of Aliza's family, Joe, Virginia, Tara (married to Todd, and her brother Jordan, in the pool. None of noticed until the next day, but they actually sat at the table next to ours at dinner. Tonight's dinner was semiformal, which meant men should wear a suit jacket or sport coat, or at the least a tie, but because they called it informal, not everyone realized this.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Tuesday, August 17</h4>
<div class="sub-entry">
<p>
Grand Cayman was the port for Tuesday. There is no suitable pier at Grand Cayman, so the ship anchored a few hundred yards off the shore and they lowered a few tender (actually the lifeboats, but when not being used to save people, they're simply tender, as in they tend to the ship's needs) to take passengers ashore. My mom had booked a private tour with Captain Marvin, a local tour company that does snorkeling and fishing trips.
</p><p>
We got a shuttle over to their dock, and headed out to the place called Sting Ray City. On the way, they handed out some snorkel gear (so we wouldn't have to lug ours all around), and I was sitting on the forward deck of the boat. I set my gear down, and then the guy at the helm gunned it. My stuff slid back and off the boat before I evewn realized it. Another passenger noticed and we stopped the boat and started looking. Of course, masks and snorkels sink, quite fast usually, but because the water is so clear, a couple guys jumped in to look for it quickly. However, the wind and currents were fairly strong that day, and we didn't find it within a few minutes, and took off. They gave me another set, and I made sure it was securely inside the boat this time.
</p><p>
On the way to the city, we stopped for a bit so snorkel around, and a videographer shot some footage of the passengers and fish. I brought a waterproof one-time-use camera and snapped some shots of fish hiding out in the coral. I turned sharply too look at something, and the camera slipped out of my pocket, I guess the velcro didn't hook up well enough. I quickly started scanning the bottom for my camera, but never found it. Just before we went back aboard the boat, I noticed my brother's camera, attached to his arm by an elastic band, trying to float. I scanned the surface for my camera, but witht he wind and currents, it was long gone.
</p><p>
Next we headed towards String Ray City. It's a vast sandbar, a few hundred or more square yards of pure sandy bottom about three to four feet deep. The stingrays expect tourists, and the tour guides all bring squid and shrimp to feed them. Each time another boat arrived, the rays would swarm them, knowing they had fresh food. Then they'd resume browsing around. They're pretty amazing creatures, flying along through the water. I'm still amazed at how quickly they can turn and change speed and direction, without seeming to do much at all. Although it's to be expected since they rely on smell for feeding, their eyes looked almost dead, a bit disconcerting. It was a very interesting experience, and the videographer of course got footage of everyone handling the creatures.
</p><p>
All that was over about lunch time, so we headed back to the ship. My sister and mother planned on going shopping, and I planned on heading to a beach after lunch, but I ended up just lounging on the ship by the pool. I think losing two things so close together put a damper on my spirits, especially since one items wasn't even mine. I left them a big tip, in addition to the one my mom left for the whole family, to make up for it. My parents also bought a copy of the video, which arrived today on a DVD.
</p><p>
Later in the day, I found Aliza and her family playing cards on one of the upper decks. I watched them play Spaded for a bit, then I taught them how to play 9-5 (a variation on Pitch, or High-Low-Jack). Aliza and her brother-in-law Todd destroyed the team of her brother Jordan and myself. Beginner's luck? Maybe, but I think I was just distracted. ;)
</p><p>
Dinner tonight was served rather quickly, and they had the curtains in the Grand Restaurant closed. This was because the ship was rolling a bit and those susceptible to motion sickness aren't affected as much if they can't see the horizon. Even so, dinner was over in about an hour and a quarter, instead of the usual two or so hours. Not that it mattered for our table, we were always one the first in, and often the last to leave, talking and generally taking full advantage of their hospitality.
</p><p>
That night I met Jason and Tanitia (not sure how she spells it though), siblings from Sacremento, and their cousin Ron, as well as Christian and Luke, siblings from I don't know where, Liz, from the southwest, and Matt, from Virginia. We ended up staying up till about 4 in the morning, with Aliza and Jordan as well. They actually closed the nightclub on the ship with us still in it.
</p>

<h4>Wednesday, August 18</h4>
<div class="sub-entry">
<p>
Wednesday brought Mexico. Cozumel, an island near Cancun, to be exact. The Ship docked, and I headed to my tour. I really don't recall what everyone else was doing that day. I got a shuttle with others to Playa Barracuda, or Barracuda Beach in English. One of the woman on the shuttle was so suprised at the name, the driver made sure we all understood it wasn't named for an abundance of the fish in the area.
</p><p>
On the way, I learned that I was the only person signed up for my excursion, the Hobie-Cat Challenge, but since it is at the same place as the powerboat excursion, they kept it open. If you don't know, a Hobie-cat is a catamaran, a twin hull boat, about ten to fourteen feet long, with one or two sails. These ones were the larger ones, with both a mainsail and a jib, the smaller sail at the front.
</p><p>
I had never sailed a boat with a jib before, only single sail Sunfish at scout camp. After some quick instruction from my guide Ramon, I got the hang of it. Since it's quite hard to have a race with only one person, we sailed the course once just for practice, then just fooled around for a couple hours. Ramon tought me how to park the boat, which is pretty cool. By taking in the jib, and hauling the mailsail in as tight as possible, you can point the boat <em>into</em> the wind, and it stays there, excepting water currents.
</p><p>
Being the geek I am, while we were swimming around the exceptionally clear waters, I figured out how parking works. The wind does not come exactly from one single direction, and these slight variations caused the boat to try and change orientation, to keep the wind in the path of least resistant over the mainsail. These small changes in orientation will push the rudder around, as well as fill the mainsail very slightly. As the boat tries to move forward, the pushed over rudder turns it the wrong way, unfilling the mainsail, and pointing it back into the wind. This happens over and over again, and the boat stays in almost the same spot.
</p><p>
Without the weight of the other two or three people we would normally have (it was the off season), we couldn't pull the mainsail in really tight without flipping, but we did manage to get one hull out of the water for a bit, and found an area with nice swells to crash through. I tought myself a couple tricks which Ramon said most people don't figure out unless they're told, like using my foot to unlock the mainsail line. With the mainsail tight, if the wind changes quickly, you can flip very easily, but using my foot to release instead of trying to snap the line out of the lock by hand, I could quickly let it out and recover. He wouldn't have let me go so fast if I didn't figure that out, because righting a flipped catamaran isn't all that fun.
</p><p>
Afterwards, they had some beer for the patrons, which was just me in this case. I drank a bunch of Dos Equis, which I'd never had, but liked a lot. This came back to haunt me though, they gave me pretty good heartburn, same as Heineken does to me. I didn't eat much during the rest of the day, and it did limit my drinking a bit. I also lost yet another item. They gave me a certificate of participation, which I left on my chair when I went to get yet another beer. Before I got back to my seat, my taxi came, and I left without taking the certificate. No big loss, but I felt bad that Ramon wrote it up, and then I left it there.
</p><p>
That night found me in Crystal Room, playing a game with Aliza, Jordan, Joe their father, and Todd. They signed me up to do karaoke, and I chose Jimmy Buffet's "Cheeseburger in Paradise". The audience seemed to really enjoy it, although I didn't give them much of a show, just standing there with my hand in my pocket.
</p><p>Later I ended up in the nightclub again, with the same crew from the night before. We didn't stay quite as late that night, instead opting to relax on the aft decks with some of our own liquor. Although the crew asks you to turn in your duty-free purchases of liquor when you re-board the ship, a number of us conveniently forgot to turn in our rum and tequila from Cozumel. ;) We were up until about 3 or so in the morning.
</p>

<h4>Thursday, August 19</h4>
<div class="sub-entry">
<p>
At sea again, although we cruised much slower than on the way to Jamaica, only needing to go 370 miles in about 37 hours. This made the ship roll a bit more than the previous days. I spent the day lounging by the pool, napping, reading, listening to music.
</p><p>
I ate a lot of ice-cream that day. I was still trying to make my stomach happy after all those Dos Equis and rum in Mexico. I spent some time in the sun without lotion on, to get a true taste of that Caribbean sun on our second to last day. I got a mild sunburn from about an hour in the early afternoon sun. It never bothered me, except when first getting into the hot tub, the water felt about 30 degrees hotter than it was, but that faded after 30 seconds or so.
</p><p>
Night time found me with the same group as before, hanging in the club. I was in a grumpy mood, for reasons I'll keep to myself. Just suffice to say it stems from one of my own flaws, nothing caused by the people around me.
</p><p>
Because I was mad, and didn't want to take it out on anyone from that group, I mingled with some others, meeting some ladies from Philly. Susan, Angelia, and Jaime knew each other through college and sports. Their other friend Janine was still tired after a long day in Cozumel and wasn't with them that night. Jaime and Angelia ended up coming aft with Christian, Luke, Liz, Matt, Aliza and myself when the club closed. We chatted, till about 3:30ish, again.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Friday, August 20</h4>
<div class="sub-entry">
<p>
Arrival in Key West meant Immigration had to check everyone's passport. We had to get up at 7:00 AM and go to the other end of the ship, so we could stand in line for a half hour. There must be a better way do to that. It was such a constrast to the relaxation of the rest of the trip.
</p><p>
In fact, I think they should skip Key West altogether, and take us to another foreign island. Key West is just like any other beach town in the States, with shops and bars literally everywhere. I just wandered around for a bit, hit the beach for a while, and contemplated renting a jet-ski. None of the vendors listed prices, however, and I was feeling to lazy to ask around to find a decent price, so I never got one.
</p><p>
I spent the rest of the afternoon by the pool yet again. I finished another book, and spent proably way too much time in the hot tubs. I tried to find Aliza's family, or anyone else, to play some cards, but they were all shopping.
</p><p>
You can guess were I was at night. In the club. Any liquor purchased at the duty-free shops was returned that night, and you could tell. Some younger kids, who weren't allowed to get beer anymore since we were officially in the U.S., must have opened some of their liquor, because they spent about two hours trying to attract the attention of every single person in the club. We eventually got tired of that, after some girl asked for the sixth time if we had seen her black sweater, and her friend had us look under our chair cushions for the third time, and left.
</p><p>
Aliza, Jordan, Christian, Luke, Angelia, and Matt, went aft again to watch Miami pass by. We saw a rain squall over southern Miami, and watched as it grew and moves further south, towards the Keys. We also counted at least 4 other cruise ships, one heading to Miami, two heading south along the Keys, and one that no one could figure out where it was headed. It was a nice relaxing night, perfect for the last of the cruise. None of us got to bed before 3 AM, yet again.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Saturday, August 21</h4>
<div class="sub-entry">
<p>
Disembarkation. Instead of running from the ship to the airport, my mom got us a hotel for the afternoon. So our disembark time was last, 9:30, which meant we got up a little past 8 AM. Everyone else I was with the night before had very early times, and I felt a twinge of pity, until I fell asleep in the lounge, waiting for our section to be called.
</p><p>
We ate lunch at the hotel, everyone napped until 4ish, when we got a shuttle to the Ft. Lauderdale airport. Our first flight arrived late, as did our second flight, from Tampa to Providence. Since we all had gotten food in Tampa, and were still in vacation mode, none of us minded the delays. We arrived home at about midnight.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Cruises are a great vacation, and I plan on taking many more during my life. You see beautiful places, the hospitality is great, and you meet some really nice people on board. And that's how my summer vacation went.
