title: About Kill Bill Vol. 2

<p>
so vol. 2 was not what most people expected. not quite what i expected at first, but turns out it really was. a live action japanese animation. if you liked the story as much as the fighting in vol. 1, go see vol. 2, you'll like it. if all you want is more fighting, you're outta luck. not that there aren't any good fights, just not as much as vol. 1. more when i wake up, i'm tired.
