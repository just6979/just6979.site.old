title: Tuckerman's!

<p>
Yesterday, Sunday, Tim, Sam, and I went to <a href="http://www.tuckerman.org/">Tuckerman's Ravine</a> on <a href="http://www.mountwashington.org/">Mount Washington</a> in New Hampshire. Tuckerman's is special because wind blows snow off the top of the mountain and piles it up to 50 FEET deep in the ravine. This means you can ski until the middle of May! Of course, first you have to hike 2.4 miles to the ravine itself, then climb up the wall to ski.

Leaving the parking lot around 10, we took about 2 hours to get to the ravine, breaked for lunch and breath, then spent almost 2 more hours climbing up the wall. But it was well worth it. It's been said Tuckerman's is THE backcountry location that all east coast skiers and riders must visit before they can call themselves hardcore. 55 degrees is the slope I've heard claimed for the steepest parts. I took an easy (if you can call any way down Tuckerman's easy) route across the headwall, under the rocks that really good guys launch off, Under those rocks, standing what felt like straight up, I could reach out and touch the wall without even straightening my arm. My knees (padded of course!) plowed through some of the large snow bumps as I traversed the slope. That is some steep stuff.

Tim and Sam both took a fall coming down the path called "Sluice". That section was quite bumpy at the top so I cut across the top and then cut through the middle to (hopefully and successfully) make it over to the lower section of "Chute". We we're going to try another run, but with the combine delays or waking up, getting gas (I should've filled it up, dang), and removing layers (the day was much warmer than most expected, so everyone was stopping to remove layers on the hike in), the sun was starting to set and the snow was getting a bit crusty. Plus, we were all totally beat from the hike and climb.

For our first trip, we had a blast. Now we know just how far the hike is and how hard the climb is, how (not) to dress, where to stop and eat (the cabin is too close to the end to stop at, I'd just go directly to Lunch Rocks in the ravine to eat), and to arrive earlier! Next time, with me and Tim in hiking boots (I wore my snowboard boots because I don't own hiking boots, and he wore skate shoes because he forgot his boots), leaving super early, packing a bit better, and being in better shape, I figure we could get 3 to 5 five runs in.

Very soon, I'll make a little script to build an album of the <a href="/media/pictures/photos/2005/04-10/Tuckerman's Ravine/">the pictures</a> I took. I'll also add Tim's when I get them transferred, and Sam's when I get them scanned. I'm also going to annotate some of the good shots Tim got to show were we went up and came down.

Oh yeah, we're thinking about going again in few weeks, Wanna go?
