So I just got a <a href="http://www.rossignolsnowboards.com/">Rossignol</a> <a href="http://www.rossignolsnowboards.com/index.php?;_lang=US;class=Product;function=display2;oidit=T005:4c05f021f1b642a2226a753c9f4d35e1;oiditProd=T005:fa3ed8fe47a15408e1781e524ca36932;template=product_detail.html">RS</a>, their top of the line all-mountain stick, less than 10 days ago. It quite simply rocks. Fast and stable on edge, incredible torsional flex, and very predictable tip and tail flex. The progressive side cut isn't too hooky but quick when you need it to be, and the core is super damp yet nicely poppy. In other words, one very sweet freeride board that can carve down to the big booters out back or butter on over to stomp some kickers in the park.

Now I'm thinking about another board for next year to get some freestyle progression going. A flexy and poppy twin tip would be super fun. I liked the Rossignol <a href="http://www.rossignolsnowboards.com/index.php?;_lang=US;class=Product;function=display2;oidit=T005:4c05f021f1b642a2226a753c9f4d35e1;oiditProd=T005:3qvz8461ccelx3yu7djufl8yr;template=product_detail.html">Alias</a> I demoed, thought I'd like to see what the higher-end <a href="http://www.rossignolsnowboards.com/index.php?;_lang=US;class=Product;function=display2;oidit=T005:4c05f021f1b642a2226a753c9f4d35e1;oiditProd=T005:3qvz8461ccelx3yu7dpf7p6ou;template=product_detail.html">Decoy</a> is like (lighter, more predictable?). <a href="http://ridesnowboards.com/">Ride</a>'s <a href="http://ridesnowboards.com/boards/board.asp?ProductID=11">DH</a> is a great all-mountain twin with park genes (think "a more stable <a href="http://ridesnowboards.com/boards/board.asp?ProductID=7">Kink</a>"). It'll hold edge most anywhere, but the buttery flex is money on rails and boxes and it's damp enough to stomp anything. I've heard very good things about <a href="http://k2snowboarding.com/">K2</a>'s <a href="http://k2snowboarding.com/products/boards/boards_detail.asp?productid=9">Darkstar</a> and <a href="http://k2snowboarding.com/products/boards/boards_detail.asp?productid=12">World Wide Weapon</a>, but I'll have to try them both. But the board I'm really wanting right now has a different flavor than all these.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.arborsports.com/06/snowboards/index.html">Arbor</a>'s <a href="http://www.arborsports.com/06/snowboards/html/mystic_06.html">Mystic</a> is a special board. Arbor uses real wood top sheets on most of their boards. Hawaiian koa gives a great feel to their freeride boards. On others, without the wood top, they add other coolstuff. The Mystic, a "technical park/pipe board" has a banboo reinforced core. Bamboo! Stronger than steel, better longevity than carbon fiber, more energy return than the usual core materials, and super light to boot. Take that bamboo-boosted full wood core and add a carbon fiber (still a great material) stringer for even more pop, super fast gallium-indium sintered base, smooth and powerful triple radius sidecut, and a four-way fiber weave for stability and control, and you've got what promises to be a very fun ride. I'd like to demo one, but Arbor is a smaller company and doesn't send out a ton of stock to demo shops. I'm going to try some fellow instructors' Arbor freeride boards (A-Frame, Element, Crossbow) to get a feel for their boards, and try to imagine that translated to a twin. It's also got a nice graphic, not overkill, but beautiful and attention grabbing. Toss in the two year warranty and I think this will be the board I get pro-formed early next season, or maybe over the summer if I see one at a good price.</p>
<p>And although I really like the Mystic on paper, if any of the boards I've already ridden pops up for the right price, I just might snap them up. I know Arbor makes killer freeride boards, so I can always fulfil my Arbor neediness with an <a href="http://www.arborsports.com/06/snowboards/html/element_06.html">Element</a> or <a href="http://www.arborsports.com/06/snowboards/html/crossbow_06.html">Crossbow</a> as I beat up the RS. However, I can't leave Rossignol's new for 06/07 One, the stiff and super poppy K2 <a href="http://k2snowboarding.com/products/boards/boards_detail.asp?productid=7">Zeppelin</a>,  or Ride's always incredible <a href="http://ridesnowboards.com/boards/board.asp?ProductID=15">Timeless</a> out of the freeride equation either.
