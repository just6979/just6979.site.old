title: Riding

<p>
I went for a mountain bike ride tonight. Fourth day in a row. I know almost every trail in the Gilbert Hills, but I often switch directions to keep it interesting. Tonight I rode what is becoming my usual 8 mile loop, but in the oppposite direction than I've usually been doing it. Wow, the reverse is much nicer. More technical climbs and longer downhills. I see now why many riders dislike the "forward" route. Too damn many loooooong climbs. It's a good workout that way, but not much more, and the average speed is much lower. In reverse, there are still enough technical descents to keep most people (me!) happy. And of course the cross trails can always be taken to extend the ride or hit extra technical sections.

I also saw a fox tonight. It was following me for a bit, but whenever I stopped it'd back away and duck behind the brush. It bolted when I turned around and slowly approached. Seeing the fox reminded me of the chipmunk I unfortuntely ran over on Tuesday. :( It jumped directly under my wheel. By the time I saw it, I felt the twin thumps. It's tail twitched a bit and then lay still. I gently picked it up and moved it off the road. Perhaps that chipmunk became a free meal for my new friend the fox.

I also shredded my shin with a pedal tonight. Drew some blood and left of couple of nice bruises, but didn't and doesn't hurt much. My pain threshhold has been getting higher as I get older. Or maybe it's all the time spent in a kitchen at work. With hot grease flying and hot metal in every direction, burns are inevitable. I have to look hard to find any burn scars anymore though. Burns seems to heal cleaner than cuts and scrapes for me.

So, although bad things can, and will happen, I still recommend everyone get on a bike and do some riding. On road of off, it's fun and healthy, and on the road it's low-impact, quite easy on the joints.

I'll have something about the cruise very soon!
