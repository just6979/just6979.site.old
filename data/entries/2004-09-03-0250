title: Crafting war

<p>
Tonight I finished the first campaign of WarCraft III: Reign of Chaos, the Human campaign: "The Scourge of Lordaeron". Wow, this is such a great game!. <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/">Blizzard</a> never fails it seems.
</p>
<p>
I've been a fan of Blizzard ever since I found a shareware version of WarCraft: Orcs And Humans on the CD of a gaming mag. That little game was awesome. The characters had <em>character</em> (Click on them to get their attention, and they'd make cute remarks. Click them over and over and they'd start complaining!), the gameplay was engaging, and it was just plain fun.
</p>
<p>
A bit later, I found the WarCraft II Demo, and that just blew my mind. Everything good about the first game, but it looked, sounded, and played even better. I quickly bought the <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war2bc/">WarCraft II: Battle Chest</a>, which included the original Tides of Darkness and the expansion, Beyond the Dark Portal. Utilizing Kahn, a little program that simulated an IPX network (an old LAN protocol) over IP (the Internet), I played a lot of "War2" online on our old 486, using a surreptitiously gained dial-up account ;).
</p>
<p>
Just before I went to <a href="http://www.uml.edu">UML</a>, I bought a new PC for myself, along with Blizzard's latest game, <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/starcraft/">StarCraft</a>. StarCraft took the play of WarCraft into the future, and into space, and of course kept the little things we know and love (the characters still got mad if you picked them repeatedly). We played a good lot of StarCraft in the dorms. My roommate Andy and I were a couple of the best players on campus.
</p>
<p>
I eventually bought the <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/starcraftbc/">StarCraft Battle Chest</a> to get a hold of the <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/broodwar/">Brood War</a> expansion set, and also <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war2bne/">WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition</a> so I could play War2 without Kahn (which slowly died) or <a href="http://www.kali.net/">Kali</a> (Kali is another IPX simulator, and more now, that has always been a pay service). <a href="http://www.battle.net/">Battle.net</a> is Blizzard's free service for finding and playing their games online. Battle.net started with their game <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo/">Diablo</a>, which I tried but never got much into, or the <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo2/">sequel</a>, but people that do like those games, like them a lot. However, I haven't played StarCraft or WarCraft II in a very long while.
</p>
<p>
Now we're back up to WarCraft III. I purchased the <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war3/faq/collectorsedition.shtml">Collector's Edition</a> shortly after it was released. This special edition comes in a nice faux-leather box, with 4 beautiful 8x10 prints (I'll scan them someday), a gorgeous book of concept art (<em>The Art of WarCraft</em>), a DVD containing all the pre-rendered cinematics and other special features, a CD of the soundtrack, a manual signed by the development team, and of course the game itself. It cost an extra $25 dollars over the $50 release price, but considering all the fun Blizzard has given me over the years, not to mention the goodies it came with, I felt it was worth it.
</p>
<p>
Now, I've had the game for around three years now, I just never got around to playing it much. I got about halfway through the first campaign back when I first got it, but then got distracted by something or other. Although classes start at <a href="http://www.bridgew.edu/">BSC</a> in 5 days, I think I should be at least 75% finished by then. Of course, there is also the expansion set, <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war3x/">The Frozen Throne</a>, which is down to less than $20 now. That should keep me busy for a while, and I'm also feeling an urge to go back and complete StarCraft and Brood War as well, since I never actually finished the final level of StarCraft before being distracted away.
</p>
<p>
So the next campaign is the Undead, which should be interesting as they have a strange biology and tech tree, kind of like the Zerg of StarCraft. I can only hope the Night Elves are the third campaign, since I've been wanting to play as them since I first heard news of WarCraft III.
</p>
<p>
Well, this is my longest entry yet. I promise I'll put up something about the cruise very soon, and that will probably be longer. That is, if I'm not playing WarCraft III all my free time! ;)
